# Energideklarationer

This package aims to provide helper functions to work with Swedish energy declarations.
Currently it allows to calculate the energy class of the building, given its `type` (_Flerbostadshus_,_Småhus_ or _Lokal_), `PET` (_primärenergital_) and `Atemp`. Optionally, a `BBR` version can be provided (BBR25, BBR29), with the current one used by default.

See `sample.py` for examples of usage.
